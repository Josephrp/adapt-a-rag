## Introduction

Adapt-a-RAG represents a groundbreaking application that harnesses the fusion of retrieval augmented generation, revolutionizing the landscape of question answering systems. By dynamically adapting to each query, Adapt-a-RAG guarantees responses finely tuned to the user's specific needs and preferences.

## Key Features

- **Adaptability**: Tailors responses to individual user queries, ensuring relevance and accuracy.
- **Data Integration**: Utilizes diverse sources including documents, GitHub repositories, and websites for comprehensive information gathering.
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Enhances performance through the creation of synthetic data using advanced techniques.
- **Dynamic Recompilation**: Adapts the application with each run based on optimized prompts and user query context.
- **Contextual Answering**: Provides contextually rich responses by leveraging optimized prompts and collected data.

## Setup

### Cloning the Repository

To get started with Adapt-a-RAG, clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Josephrp/adapt-a-rag.git
```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuring Environment

Configure essential API keys and environment variables.

### Launching the Application

Launch the application with:
```
python main.py
```

## Functionality

### Data Acquisition

The application gathers data from multifarious sources, including documents, GitHub repositories, and websites. It employs specialized reader classes like `CSVReader`, `DocxReader`, `PDFReader`, `ChromaReader`, and `SimpleWebPageReader` to extract pertinent information.

### Synthetic Data Generation

Leveraging the collected data, Adapt-a-RAG creates synthetic data through advanced techniques such as data augmentation and synthesis. This process enriches the training dataset, enhancing the application's performance.

### Prompt Refinement

The synthesized data is utilized to fine-tune the prompts within Adapt-a-RAG. By optimizing prompts based on generated data, the application ensures the generation of precise and context-aware responses.

### Dynamic Recompilation

With each run, Adapt-a-RAG dynamically recompiles itself based on optimized prompts and the specific user query. This adaptive recompilation enables the application to tailor responses, delivering personalized answers.

### Question Answering

Upon recompilation, Adapt-a-RAG processes the user query, retrieving relevant information from the collected data sources. It then generates responses using optimized prompts, thereby furnishing accurate and contextually rich answers.

## Use Cases

- **Education**: Assist students with their queries by providing comprehensive answers sourced from relevant educational materials.
- **Technical Support**: Offer tailored solutions to technical queries by retrieving information from documentation and repositories.
- **Research**: Aid researchers in finding pertinent literature and resources by generating contextually relevant responses.
